                "<h2>Chapter 2</h2><p>The door shut loudly and even before he could shout for him, Ace knew it was Luffy by the loud steps.</p><p>&quot;Aceee!&quot; Slowly walking in, Luffy collapsed his weight on his brother's shoulders. Ace turned to meet his brother's face inches from his one. &quot;Look!&quot; Luffy held up his hand, way too close to his face. &quot;Torao took care of me up good!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yeah? The bite?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mhm!&quot; Luffy threw his jacket on the &quot;clothes chair&quot; and flopped on the couch.</p><p>As lively as his tone might have suggested he was, Ace knew he was exhausted. &quot;Hey, Lu? Wanna order Chinese takeout?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah! That sounds great.&quot;</p><p>The dial tone ran a couple of times. &quot;Hello, yes, can I get five of the fried duck, four rice with vegetables, and two portions of spring rolls.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nooo, get five!&quot; Luffy called from the other end of the room.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Actually, can you make it five spring rolls? Yeah. Thanks. The address is-&quot;</p><p>Luffy had stopped listening when Ace's words stopped being about food. (A d d s t u f f h e r e f o r s m o o t h e r t r a s i t i o n) He only had two things on his mind and only one of them wasn't making him hungry. He traced the outline of the dog's bite and then brushed at the scar on his chest over the fabric of his shirt. He would never forget the first time he met Traffy.</p><p>Around three years ago, Ace got in a horrible car accident in a police chase. It was something extremely stupid, a misunderstanding in fact. But lieutenant Akainu, who hated the brothers, was there. Ace told him to fuck off and drove off, so the lieutenant started chasing them. Before they knew it, one second Ace was turning back to see how close the police car was, and the other second, their car swerved and they crashed into a construction sight. Ace was impaled on a tube and Luffy had flown out of the window, falling chest-first on a a steel building accessory - Franky. He didn't remember much of what happened after that, but the head architect filled him in on some details. He clearly remembered seeing the blue-haired man calling an ambulance and Akainu standing on the sidelines, a grimace close to a smile tugging on his wrinkles.</p><br><br><br><br>",

                "<h2>Chapter 2.0</h2><p>Trafalgar D. Water Law had three alarms set. One for an hour and twenty minutes before he has to go to work, one an hour before hw has to go to work and now thirty-five minutes later. Every morning he would go back to sleep after the first alarm, take a nap for twenty, to wake up at the second. Just enough for him to get NREM power nap. He would get up, make his bed, get breakfast in the form of a black coffee and grab a fruit from the fridge.</p><p>Most importantly - he would wash his hands and face, looking at himself careful - making sure that there was no spots or wrinkles. Anything that would suggest he didn't just wake up had to be erased.</p><p>Then he would take his work bag - check-in for the important three &quot; keys, wallet, phone. After that he would get in his car, drive to the hospital and greet anyone on his way. He never made an effort to seem nice, being polite was enough for people to notice him and that was enough. If there was anyone who would ask about hos whereabouts, they'd be able to pinpoint when and where he was because of his punctuality. That was good.</p><p>Predictability was a good thing. Having a tight schedule was the best alibi. He would take extra shifts and have appointments under fake names every once in a while as to have an hour or two of sleep at least during the day. No one would blame him for sleeping in his office, if he was caught, when his appointment was cancelled or simply never showed.</p><p>Because how could he have time to go to the other side of the city, harvest someone's organs, ship them off to a random red cross office and be back in time for his first alarm. Surly, he was only sleeping...</p><p>.</p><p>Trafalgar D. Water Law's real morning started in the dead of night.</p><p>Once he got home, Law would make sure he got ready to sleep next to open windows, if any curious neighbors were to be called as witnesses. He would shut the blinds and lay in bed for no more than half an hour. After which he would get dressed, apply the tattoo covering makeup on his arms, his helium flask and pack a change of clothes, a pack of cigarettes and his tire-track diy kit. He would walk or jog to where he needed to go.</p><p>And so he did on the night that for the first time in all the years he's done and planned so meticulously, he got caught.</p><p>Vergo was a high ranking officer in the police force. In many people's eyes he was a role model, for some - an outstanding officer, for most - just another cop. But Law knew what he was. Vergon would always be the man who covered up after the murderer off his farther. He would forever be the man who covered up and assisted in the kidnapping of children that Law could never trace back to him. Being a pawn of the government was bad enough, but abusing the power he was given was a new low.</p><p>Law had been tracing him, committing to memory his habits and usual afterwork routine. All for this moment. He had left an organ thermal box, hiden near by so he can simply buy ice from the near by twenty-four seven store and fill it up.</p><p>He looked at his watch, making sure he still had around fifteen minutes until Vergo came to the spot Law decided to jump him. He took a large swig of his helium flask before entering the store and pulled up his mask. If he inhaled it all now, by the time he was at the counter, his voice would pitch, but not too much as to be unbelievable. He coughed a couple of times, loud enough for the cashier to assume his mask was a health precaution. He quickly bought a pack of ice, making sure the employee heard a high voice that Law couldn't produce on his own.</p><p>Walking over to the spot, he put the ice in the box (????) and waited around the corner. He changed his clothes into his &quot;surgeon jumpsuit&quot;, that covered his entire body, gloves and a helmet-like straw mask that would cover his face.</p><p>Checking his watch again, the surgeon saw that Vergo finally appeared.</p><p>Just a few steps further and he qould be in Law's range. Just a few-</p><p>&quot;Hey!&quot; A far too familiar voice that did not belong to Vergo called after the policeman.</p><p>The surgeon watched in horror as what he suspected happened. Luffy, the firefighter with the worst timing ran up to the surgeon's future victim. He almost didn't recognise the shorter man, as the horrifyingly angry expression on his face made him look like a different person.</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Vergo turned around.</p><p>&quot;I saw what you did back there.&quot; Luffy clenched his fists. He looked ready to fight. This was the last thing Law needed right now.</p><p>&quot;I don't know what you are referring to, citizen.&quot; Vergo put a hand on the hilt of a gun Law hidden under his jacket.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Luffy jumped on top of the other man. The gun - knocked out of Vergo's hand but not before a shot was fired in desparation.</p><p>The policeman was not small in any sense of the word, he was taller and wider than Luffy. But from the way the shorter was handling him, one would think he was but a rag doll. He flipped the larger man on his stomach, bending his arm begind his back. It looked painful enough to break. Vergo shouted in pain.</p><p>&quot;What did you do to those kids! Where are you taking them!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fuck you!&quot; The other spat</p><p>Luffy's face twitched. Moving the arm, a snapping sounded and the man screamed out in pain.</p><p>Shit...</p><p>&quot;Fine.&quot; Luffy snarled and let go of the arm, now bent in an unnatural angle. &quot;I'll find out on my own.&quot; He ran a gand down the other's spune and elbowed him around the neck area.</p><p>If he hit the tight spot and it broke, the surgeon mused, then his diafragma would lose function and he would asphyxiate. He would only live for no more than several minutes. But how would Luffy know that? More importantly, the surgeon couldn't believe he just witnessed a man like Luffy murder in cold blood.</p><p>The firefighter seemed to be happy enough with the outcome of the situation, as he started leaving.</p><p>Slowly walking out from the shadows, Law thought to himself, if the man was already dead, he might as well harvest what was salvageable. If not, he was already immobilized, so finishing the job wouldn't have been hard.</p><p>He just couldn't let himself think about what he'd seen just yet. He knew it would make him spiral and he had limited time.</p><p>He flipped the body over, flashing a light in the man's pupils. Unresponsive. He took out a knife and his scalpel and started dissecting. He had one good kidney, smoker lungs, which implied the heart might not be good enough to use.</p><p>Just as he thought he was almost done, the flopping of a pair of familiar sandals sounded at an alarming speed to him. He couldn't just leave or stop the organ, it was a waste. So he was forced to pause to stare at the idiot, hands buried into a corp's intestans. He could only hope, pray and bed for Luffy not to attack him the way he did Vergo.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Luffy furrowed his brows. &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p><p>The surgeon stayed quiet.</p><p>&quot;I forgot... something, so can you scram?&quot; He sounded annoyed.</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; His amazement at his words made Law forget the predicament he was in as well. &quot;What are you, an idiot?&quot;</p><p>Luffy's eyes widened and for a second the surgeon feared that with this he might have angered him enough to warrent the same treatment as their victim. But then a warm and genuine smile crossed over the shorter's face. &quot;Torao?&quot;</p><p>Law's blood ran cold. How could he recognize him from just that? He looked at his watch once more, confirming his fear that he was much too short on time and quickly started taking the organ again.</p><p>Luffy started walking over to the two men with a skip in his step. &quot;It is you! What are you doing!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up.&quot; Law spat, not looking at the younger man, still trying his best to get the organ in prime condition. Finally, he placed it in the iced box and turned to see Luffy, pouting and watching him grumpily.</p><p>He couldn't leave him like this. Under the pressure, knowing the cops would show up soon, Law did the only thing he could think of and grabbed Luffy by the arm.</p><p>Avoiding any main roads and light areas, the surgeon hurried to get as far away as he could. Finally in the privacy behind a dumpster, he started stripping out of his jumpsuit, leaving his helmet on. If Luffy's eyes lingered a bit too long, he didn't notice, too concentrated on putting on the clean change of clothes he had.</p><p>&quot;Torao, what are you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop calling me that! I'm not...&quot; He sighed.</p><p>&quot;I know how to recognize your voice, Traffy.&quot; Luffy said seriously.</p><p>Law finally took off the helmet. &quot;We need to talk. About...&quot; he gestured un the area between them, &quot;this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p>The sudden seriousness should have unnerved him, but Law was just relieved that Luffy finally started taking the situation they were in seriously.</p><p>The surgeon didn't know what to do, where it would be safe to talk. What he knew was that he had to leave the organ first. He couldn't risk people starting to walk around. He had chosen an area with practically no night life - reducing the chance of them running into people. He knew the red cross offices had started installing cameras at the front doors. Most of the models they used looked like a cheap Alecto DC-KIT - Dummy camera set. Still, to stay on the safe side, Law stood in the blind spot and stuck a large magnet onto it. He left the box and took back his magnet.</p><p>Walking away, he realized that he had his fingers intertwined with Luffy's the whole time. What's more - he had been quietly going along with everything Law was doing.</p><p>He couldn't bring him to a public place, he couldn't bring him home, so in the panic of watching the sun slowly starting to rise, he took a turn for the dog park. People usually walked their dogs at this hour so they'd look inconspicuous enough if anyone saw them.</p><p>They were already walking on the grass to a bench when he felt a gentle squeeze of his hand.</p><p>&quot;Let's just sit for a bit.&quot; Law gestured, trying to sound as calm as possible. The truth was he was far from calm. Every cell in his body was on edge and was ready to bolt or fight if necessary. Hopefully it won't come to that.</p><p>&quot;So you're the surgeon guy?&quot; Luffy said. &quot;The killer who targets the mafia or whatever?&quot;</p><p>Law could hear his blood rushing out of him. He was going to have a panic attack. All these years, all this work to stay under the radar. And for what?</p><p>Deciding that there's no honor or sense in denying it, he confessed. &quot;Yes,&quot; not to mention the confirmation didn't put him entirely in a disadvantage, as he also watch Luffy murder a police officer. A corrupt one, but a cop nonetheless.</p><p>&quot;Relax. I'm not gonna tell the police, I hate those guys.&quot; Luffy huffed, sounding a bit more like himself again.</p><p>Since Law didn't know where to start, he started from the beginning. &quot;Alright, what exactly did you see?&quot;</p><p>// IDK ABT THIS BIT</p><br><br><br><br>",

                "<h2>Chapter 3</h2><p>They entered an appointment in the center of the city. Law hesitantly entered after Luffy. He still wasn't sure what the man's agenda was and was even less sure if it was a good idea to go into the home of a man he watched beat to death another man, much stronger, much larger and much more skilled in hand to hand combat than him.</p><p>However it was too late for him to back out of it.</p><br><br><br><br>",

                "<h2>Chapter 6</h2><p>The week had been far too tame. Sunday could not have come slower. Luffy's foot bounced up and down as he was forced to sit through the gear maintenance checks.</p><p>&quot;Would you quit that?&quot; Hyogoro grumbled.</p><p>&quot;Ughhh,&quot; Luffy groaned. &quot;It's so boring though. Why couldn't I just go with the guys who got that call? almost everyone else went!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because you can't be patient if your life depended on it, not come and help me lift this up.&quot; The old man waved his finger.</p><p>Luffy did as he was told with little complaining and ignored the phone vibrating in his pocket. Gear maintenance checks were important and took up a lot of time. No firefighter would take it lightly, but it didn't stop Luffy from wishing there was something more interesting to do.</p><p>&quot;Alright, I think the truck is good. Want to take a break?&quot; Hyogoro asked.</p><p>&quot;Yeahhh, I'm starving!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's not even lunchtime!&quot; The old man laughed.</p><p>.</p><p>&quot;Oh, your boy is coming this way.&quot; Penguin pointed out.</p><p>Sanji looked over to see Luffy and the old man walking towards the diner.</p><p>The cook took a long drag from his cigarette and exhaled deeply. &quot;So much for my smoke break.&quot; Putting out his cigarette, he turned to the man running towards him.</p><p>Luffy jumped to hug Sanji, the cook - already in a comfortable stance to not fall, caught him. &quot;Sanji!&quot; Luffy laughed.</p><p>&quot;Hey Luffy. I hope you plan on paying.&quot; Sanji patted his back.</p><p>Getting down on the ground, the firefighter frowned. &quot;I'm offended that you even think this!&quot;</p><p>Sanji took out another cigarette. &quot;Yeah, well, I'm holding down two jobs and staking out the broker's market, I can't keep covering your tabs.&quot; He watched the younger cross his arms in shame. Well... as much shame as Luffy could have. &quot;I'll tell you what: when I get my own restaurant, I'll give you special discounts. Okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yoshhhh!&quot; Luffy punched the air in excitement.</p><p>They both knew that it was not true. What was most likely to happen would be Luffy freeloading most of the time and sometimes repaying with menial tasks or chores.</p><p>Luffy made his way into the diner and before he noticed, everything from the menu, and some things off it, started appearing on their table. Sanji knew him well.</p><p>&quot;Slow down! You might choke.&quot; Hyogoro said worriedly.</p><p>The other firefighter ignored the warning in favor of looking at his phone. It was buzzing with old messages. He scrolled through most of them, thinking of answering later but then stopped on one. Shocked, he gasped, choking on the unchewed food still in his mouth.</p><p>&quot;Didn't I tell you this would happen!&quot; The old man barked.</p><p>Luffy just stared at the screen. He blinked a couple of times, a smile finally appearing. &quot;Look!&quot; He shoved the chat in the other firefighter's face. &quot;This is a date right?&quot; He was bouncing in his seat. &quot;It was sent a couple of hours ago, aw man.&quot; Luffy frowned before shrugging and started tapping on his phone.</p><p>.</p><p>And so the anticipation for the end of the week started.</p><p>.</p><p>During the first few days Luffy found himself at work and at the clinic with Ace - telling him all about the date he was planning. Seeing Ace encourage him and giving him tips to woo &quot;the special somebody&quot; made their conversations seem as natural and light as the days before the</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>He hovered above the toilet, flushing it for the third time in a row. His hands left bloody trails on the button only making it more irritating. The small bone fragments bobbed up and down in the water, a stray eyeball floating in the toilet bowl.</p><p>Nika rubbed his face with a sigh, trying to calm his nerves. With one last look at the man on the floor. Splayed next to the floor, the circle and writing on the walls, neck crushed, face prosthetic indented into his skull, nails broken.</p><p>&quot;Right, I almost forgot!&quot; Luffy rolled his eyes with a smile. &quot;How silly.&quot;</p><p>He crouched down and picked up the knife off the floor. Like one would chop a carrot, the fingers detached one by one. Picking them up, Nika went to put them in his pocket, freezing for a moment and then took out a plastic zip-lock baggy and put them away. He walked over to the mirror of the toilet, seeing his face. Or perhaps it was more accurate to say he couldn't see his face.</p><p>The blood was clinging onto his hair, making half of it stick in unnatural angles, the other half looked glued to his scalp - where he had ran his hands through it. His face was painted in big splotches, only his eyes and the place around his nose free of the rapidly hardening liquid.</p><p>With a groan, Luffy started splashing his face to clean himself somewhat.</p><p>Walking downstairs, he searched all the cabinets, leaving blood all over them as his gloves leaked. Finally finding what he was searching for, he took out the pan. Opening the fridge, he got anything edible, munching while grabbed the products he wanted. Three eggs, rice, bread, salt, pepper and... maybe some onion.</p><p>A radio was placed next to the sink. Luffy turned it on and changed channel's until he heard the familiar &quot;Bink's Sake&quot;.</p><p>He smiled wider and started whistling along with the king of soul. He loved that song.</p><p>He whistled happily along the melody.</p><p>Taking out the fingers he sliced them vertically, taking out the bone, setting them aside. Luffy set the stove on low with butter, letting it get golden. Afterwards, he added the salt and pepper, adding dry parsley at the last moment. While the butter soaked in the taste of the spices, he chopped the meat into small bite-sized pieces. The onion diced in smaller cubes . He added them in the pan, letting them get cooked and cracked the eggs in a bowl, scrambling them while raw.</p><p>Operating with gloves was uncomfortable and irritating, especially when they kept on mixing blood with his food, but there really wasn't any choice was there.</p><p>Luffy added the onion and stirred until the edges were a bit crispy. Lastly, he added the egg, turning it each way until cooked.</p><p>It didn't look or smell as good as Sanji's cooking, upon taking a bite, he realized something horrible. He paused and looked back at the fork with the cooked severed finger on it.</p><p>&quot;This guy tastes so fucking bad.&quot; He scoffed but still ate every last bit. Before leaving, he remembered what he'd been told about saliva was traceable and washed the cutlery and dishes he used, annoyed that even then, he'd still have to do chores.</p><p>He left through the backdoor, the small bones and nails making a satisfying clanking noise in his pocket.</p><p>It was a day after that he got a call from his friend. When he picked up, the line went dead immediately.</p><p>He knew what that meant. Usually, Luffy would just go to their house, but this time, he decided to wait it out. The excitement for the date with Traffy had him all jittery. It would be fine of for once he didn't respond to them, right?</p><p>Apparently, that was not right. That Friday afternoon, his doorbell rang, only as a warning, as they had keys to his apartment. A pick woke him up from his slumber, falling from the couch and onto the floor. &quot;Ouch.&quot; Luffy rubbed his head and turned to look up at his friends looming over him.</p><p>&quot;Oh, hey guys!&quot; He smiled.</p><p>&quot;You think you should be doing something right now little man?&quot; The older voice asked him.</p><p>The firefighter opened his mouth, closing it right after. He crunched up his nose and huffed. &quot;I feel like this is a trick question.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, no kidding, bro! You're acting so not super!&quot; The older man pointed at him acusitory.</p><p>&quot;Franky,&quot; the woman placed her hand on his shoulder. &quot;Let me handle this.&quot; She knelt down to meet Luffy's eye.</p><p>&quot;Yeah! Listen to your wife, Franky!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Captain, please, we need to talk about this.&quot; Robin was serious. &quot;I was called over for the Nika victim. Nika had written something on the walls again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah I know.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course.&quot; She smiled at him faintly. &quot;Do you know what it said?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Stop acting like I'm a child. I remember it all. I memorised the basics at least.&quot; He paused. Looking into her eyes, Luffy spoke again, calm and firm. &quot;He's dead. It's okay now.&quot;</p><p>She struggled to keep the smile on her face. &quot;I never searched for revenge. I just want to live...&quot;</p><p>The warm-radiating smile appeared on Luffy's face again. &quot;I know, now you can.&quot;</p><p>Something behind her face cracked and she started crying, giving Luffy a tight hug.</p><p>The walls in the mansion, now sealed away by yellow police tape, carried Luffy's message as a terrifying warning for those who needed it and as a comforting promise. Nika will free the slaves and slay the rest. //idk if i like the message tbh idk should i change???</p><p>&quot;It was still reckless.&quot; Franky said, with much less bite. &quot;I'm just worried that you're active while there's a man out there - a stranger! That knows about you!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Traffy is not a stranger.&quot;</p><p>Franky was pacing. &quot;It's only a matter of time until he traces us back to you and then we're screwed. Not to mention that Robin already volunteers at the same place as a murderer who harvests organs!&quot; Taking a deep breath and exhaling long and painful. &quot;I'm sorry, I'm just worried. I'm not doubting your judgment.&quot;</p><p>Robin finally pulled back and started wiping her tears. A great weight had lifted off her chest.</p><p>.</p><p>...</p><p>.</p><p>Law looked at the calendar - 26th of May - circled in red. The week had flown by too fast for him to deal with something like this. The doctor wasn't mentally ready, then again, perhaps he never would be.</p><p>He made sure to mention to Bepo and the nurse on front desk duty that he was going on a date. Law didn't give a name, in case it was just needless paranoia, and called it a &quot;date&quot; to make the rumour-living people remember it. It was perfect, as he could shut it down as &quot;not working out&quot;, but also had people vouch for him if anything happened to him. If bad came to worse, the police would find his chat with Luffy and piece two and two. Now that he was aware of the other's game, he made sure to back up his chat on his laptop, not trusting that Luffy would leave any electronics with Law's corpse.</p><p>The doctor was parked in front of the restaurant, gripping the wheel.</p><p>He hadn't slept all night from nerves. Was this what people on death row felt?</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he got out of the car and into the restaurant.</p><p>&quot;Hello, do you have a reservation?&quot; The hoastess asked.</p><p>&quot;Yes, is there a reservation for Mr. Monkey D. Luffy?&quot;</p><p>The hostess looked at him with a sparkle in her eyes. &quot;Ah, yes, of course. Right this way, please.&quot; She walked through the restaurant, past all the tables and the rich snobs on them. At that moment, Law was glad he dressed in a four piece suit.</p><p>Confusion struck him as they got to the end of the restaurant and she opened the door to the back. Was she in on it? Was she one of the friends that Luffy told? Fuck, he knew this was a mistake, and yet the surgeon couldn't help but feel impressed by the sharp wit of his soon-to-be killer.</p><p>With little fuss, he followed the woman up the fire-escape stairs to the rooftop.</p><br><br><br><br>",

                "<h2>Chapter 9.0</h2><p>It was Wednesday. That meant that Law would usually be at work, but for now - he was on call. It also meant that Luffy had to clear out his schedule to spend more time with his new boyfriend.</p><p>Well... Torao never liked that word, so the firefighter just had to find another word. In any case - they were on a date and that was all that mattered.</p><p>As if the doctor could hear the other's thoughts, he snapped his head to look at Luffy and sighed. &quot;How many times do I have to say it, Luffy-ya? This is not a date.&quot; He let go of his binoculars, leaving them to dangle off his neck. &quot;Stop staring at me like that.&quot; The surgeon took Luffy's hands into his own and pulled them away from his legs. &quot;And for fuck's sake, stop feeling me up, this is possibly the worst time to be doing this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So if I wait till we get to your place I can do it then?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. No- just,&quot; a sigh, &quot;just shut up and keep your eyes on the target.&quot; Law said and lifted the binoculars that Luffy had up.</p><p>With an unpleased grumble, Luffy did as he was told and continued looking at the boring guy they were supposed to kill. He had been doing nothing all day. Just some guy - hunched over on the desk.</p><p>His foot started fidgeting, his eyes roamed around, looking at the house... It looked kind of nice. There was a bird nest on the tree next to it. And... what was that? feathers in the nest? Nice. Bird designers. Luffy's eyes kept looking around, just to land, once more, on Torao.</p><p>Luffy lowered his binoculars. The ink looked so pretty on him. His tanned skin, with the little white splotches barely visible from his unbuttoned shirt... Until recently, the firefighter didn't even know Law had those. They made him look like one of those tasty chocolate cows in advertisements. The train of thought was starting to make him hungry. Hungry for chocolate, hungry for Law... both?</p><p>&quot;Stop staring.&quot; Law deadpanned, this time not even looking away from their target.</p><p>&quot;But I like you.&quot;</p><p>Trafalgar's face got the reddish tint Luffy had learned to love. Dropping his binoculars and blinking a couple of times at Luffy, Law sputtered. &quot;What is wrong with you? You can't- I mean- that's not an excuse for you to...&quot; He gestured up and down.</p><p>&quot;But you kissed me just last week. So you like me too!&quot; It wasn't a question.</p><p>Torao sighed and looked at him. He had that look on his face when he wondered if he should lie or not. &quot;It was a spur of the moment thing... Purely physical and definitely a mistake.&quot; Luffy scrunched up his nose, having a bit more trouble deciphering this one. He wasn't one hundred percent honest but it seemed like he was lying. To Luffy or to himself, there was no way of knowing at that point in time.</p><p>&quot;Physical...&quot; The firefighter muttered under his breath. He could work with that. In fact, he could test it out right there and then.</p><p>Not breaking eye contact for a moment, Luffy leaned into the surgeon. Traffy barely moved back, until there was no place left behind him. Being caged by Luffy's arms, his face hovering with hot breaths exchanging. There was something so thrilling... no... eerie about the way the firefighter's eyes stayed wide open while the other could barely keep them from shutting and slamming their faced in again.</p><p>The surgeon felt a hand, strong and steady slide to the inside of the middle of his thigh - spreading them wider so the distance was shortened. Luffy's other hand creeped up to Law's neck. His fingers on his pulsion - thumb brushed over his bottom lip.</p><p>Luffy tilted his head a bit, as if going in for a kiss making Law close his eyes in anticipation.</p><p>&quot;Your heart's so fast Traffy...&quot;</p><p>Law could feel the grin on the other's face but when he tried leaning in to shut the other up, Luffy slammed his head back and pulled away.</p><p>&quot;But you said this is the worst time to do this?&quot;</p><p>Law could feel every inch that Luffy touched burn. He couldn't admit it but he was starting to get riled up.</p><p>&quot;Are you sure you don't like me?&quot; The firefighter asked.</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Law did his best to sound convincing but it was barely a sigh.</p><p>Luffy's smile made his eyes crinkle at the edges. &quot;Then I'll just have to make you fall for me.&quot; It was said with such confidence that Law almost believed in him. &quot;Purely physical is a start though.&quot; He flopped back to where he was before, grabbing his binoculars and starting to look at the house as it was the most interesting thing.</p><p>After what felt like eternity of Law blinking in disbelief, Luffy turned around to look at him with furrowed brows. &quot;Come on Torao, stop staring at me and keep track of the security shift change. The tall guy is just about to switch with the sleepy guy.&quot;</p><p>Seeing the perplexed expression on Traffy's face almost made Luffy laugh, but he managed to keep it to himself.</p><p>.</p><p></p><p>The phone rung. A stroll with the wheely office chair and the woman grabbed the receiver. &quot;Hello, this is Kuina and Zoro Detective Agency, how may I help you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, Kuina, darling! How lovely to hear your voice!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah, hi Sanji, what's up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oi!&quot; A man's voice shouted from the other side of the door. &quot;Tell that shitty cook not to hold up the line. He's stopping real clients from reaching us!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What did that damned mosshead say!?&quot; Sanji yelled.</p><p>&quot;Oh, wait, Zoro actually wanted to get ahold of you for some reason.&quot; Kuina said.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, that's why I'm calling. He's not answering his cellphone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mhm, he's probably forgot it somewhere again. Don't worry, I'll call him over.&quot; Kuina covered the mic and yelled out Zoro's name.</p><p>The greenhaired man took the receiver out of her hand. &quot;I've got information for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What happened to &quot;hello, how are you?&quot; Does underwater-plant-life-school not cover the basics of human communication?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shut up for one moment. This is serious.&quot; Zoro scowled. &quot;It's about Luffy.&quot;</p><p>A long silence and then a blowing of air was heard from the other end. The cook was probably taking a drag of his cigarette. &quot;I'm listening.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Remember the hospitals Nami had me checking to snoop into Luffy's crush?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah? And you found nothing, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;At first - yes.&quot; He didn't know how to approach this. &quot;There's a guy, I'm sure it's him and usually I wouldn't care but he looked familiar, so I dug around and found out he's connected to the Donquixotes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shouldn't you be telling this to Nami? She's the one who hired you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You know exactly why I'm not telling her and you instead.&quot;</p><p>&quot;... yeah.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Plus it was a while ago. He was a child but people just don't just get out of families like that.&quot;</p><p>Another long pause. &quot;Let's meet up soon.&quot; The caution of talking about things like this over the phone was left unspoken.</p><p>Zoro let out a grunt in confirmation.</p><br><br><br><br>",

                "<h2>Chapter 10.0</h2><p>One who dances on the moon Who laughs like thunder Who catches lightning. Bound by chains of immortality His love for mortals enchanting (selah)</p><p>Childish and angry, Strong and ancient, Joyboy, Joyboy, Nika will smile (selah)</p><p>(429-437, C56, temple carvings)</p><p>In this text, the usual structure of four, tree lines is used, as in customary grandlinenian poetry. In the first line, the moon could be referring to three separate myths.</p><p>The first might be a reference to Nika's infamous fight with the Great Dragon of the East. It lasts three days and three nights until Nika comes out victorious. It is in the same story that Nika uses both thunder and lightning, thunder that echoes with his heartbeat and lightning which he uses lightnings as spears. This is the most likely and popular version.</p><p>The second is that the moon is referring to Tra-Ga, the grandlineian moon god. As the word used in the text is &quot; T&#1055;&#8704;&#8710;&#1043;&Iuml; &quot; which in rare occasions could be read as Traagii, but is most likely an old way of spelling &quot;thepaag&quot; - meaning moon. The reason the moon god is assumed to be in the text is linked to the 103-108, C21 text. Unfortunately, it is partially destroyed but this what has been recovered: //this last part seems a bit unprofecional.</p><p>- and death will come for*&sup1; Nika The moon covering*&sup2; the sun, And the sun was silent*&sup3; for an hour. And hour for death where the moon killed the sun.</p><p>(103-108, C21, temple carvings)</p><p>Here, the word &quot;moon&quot; was written with the same &quot; T&#1055;&#8704;&#8710;&#1043;&Iuml; &quot; as in the 429-437, C56 text.</p><p>Some believe that the moon god, or as in some texts - god of death, is also the reason why in the next line, the grandlinian word for &quot;mortals&quot; is &quot;shiiga&quot;, which could also mean &quot;death&quot; or &quot;deadly&quot;, instead of the commonly used &quot;shanaga&quot; which could mean &quot;fate&quot; or &quot;doom&quot;.</p><p>The third interpretation suggests that the sun god Nika would take times during the night to move the moon and dance alongside it. However, there is little to no reason for the claim to be considered true, other than an imagery on a vase, depicting Nika jumping with the moon in his hand. [image 21].</p><p>In the second verse, we see Nika's name used as he is referred in Red Line scripts - Joyboy. This is a result and proof of the trading system of the Red Line tribes. Their ships and trade routs were extremely well developed and reason for their influence through all the Blues. Other signs for Red Line presence are the paints used after the second stone revolution and the sudden appearance of rare metals in forms of jewellery and a couple of coins.</p><p>.</p><p>Footnote: *&sup1; in some translations seen as &quot;embrace&quot; as in 204 C49, the partial determination of the engravement makes translators unsure *&sup2; &quot;covering&quot;, in the chamber transcripts of the &quot;population of river village&quot; a word with the same root is used for repopulating and &quot;pleasure of life giving&quot; // is this too much? am i laying it on too thick??? *&sup3; &quot;silent&quot; or &quot;silenced&quot;</p><p>.</p><p>&laquo; From &quot;Nika: myth and cult&quot;, by Nico Robin &raquo;</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Leaving Ace's house, Luffy still had a bad feeling. His legs led him to the hospital and he asked for Traffy. The nurse at the front and he were already friends with how many times he would come to visit. The doctor had around half an hour left from his shift, but it seemed to pass by so fast when Luffy kept talking to the nurse.</p><p>Torao was late. Well, he wasn't late, he was avoiding Luffy, waiting for Luffy to go away. But the joke was on him, because the firefighter was going nowhere. He took his phone out.</p><p>The line rang around three times before the line went dead. The sound of familiar footsteps and a deep sigh made Luffy turn to the doctor - walking toward him.</p><p>&quot;Hello, Luffy-ya, nurse...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hello, Doctor.&quot; The nurse smiled. &quot;You shouldn't leave your boyfriend waiting like that.&quot; A giggle.</p><p>&quot;We're not- it's-&quot; Trafalgar stumbled over his words, looking over to Luffy for help, and receiving none. The firefighter only looked at him with wide eyes and a smile, expectingly. &quot;Nevermind.&quot; The surgeon turned to thw other man. &quot;What are you doing here? I told you I'm busy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wanted to see you though. And you're free now!&quot;</p><p>Law looked to the nurse. &quot;Sorry about this, I'm clocking out now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright, Doctor, have fun you two.&quot; The nurse waved with a smile.</p><p>As they turned to walk out, Torao grabbed Luffy with more force than necessary. &quot;I'm not free now. And what's with the &quot;boyfriend&quot; thing, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Are you doing plan stuff?&quot;</p><p>Law stopped dragging him, now in the middle of the parking lot. &quot;What? No. I have... personal stuff. And don't avoid my question! We're not boyfriend's, so don't spread that around.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're allays though. And we go on dates.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Dates?&quot;</p><p>&quot;The restaurant, your house, the park thing for that guy, your house again...&quot;</p><p>Law blinked at him dumbly. &quot;Those weren't dates!&quot; The doctor froze up, realizing he was speaking way too loudly, looking to check if anyone was around to witness their verbal sdeniparring. &quot;Ugh...-</p><p>He started walking to his car, Luffy following intoe.</p><p>&quot;Hey, you can't just walk away from me.&quot; Now Luffy was raising his voice.</p><p>Trying to ignore him, Trafalgar fumbled with his keys. &quot;Why, 'cause you'll out me?&quot; His attempt at sarcasm failed miserably.</p><p>A hand grabbed him by the shoulder, spinning him around to look at Luffy. The firefighter was pinning him to the car, bodies pressed against each other, wide palms digging into the doctor's shoulders.</p><p>&quot;Because you like me and we're friends. And because you want to talk.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're not friends.&quot; Law spat out the word like a curse. &quot;And I certainly don't like you. We're colleagues at best.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I never knew you kissed your colleagues like that...&quot; Luffy's grip loosened in favor of inching their faces closer. He pushed the leg in between Law's own. &quot;You're either the most repressed man on earth, or you're in deep denial.&quot;</p><p>The more Trafalgar squirmed and tried to move away, the harder he could feel himself getting. There was no way Luffy wasn't feeling it too, and with the intense stare a mere inch from him, Law felt like he was going insane.</p><p>&quot;I'm not going to force you into anything.&quot; Luffy's leg pressed forward making Law bite the inside of his cheeks to keep himself quiet. &quot;But bottling it up will help no one.&quot;</p><p>He pulled away and just like that the pressure and pleasure was gone.</p><p>&quot;So where are you going?&quot; Luffy asked so casually, one would think they were discussing the weather until then.</p><p>&quot;Uh...&quot; Law rubbed the place where Luffy's hand used to be. &quot;A soup kitchen... I volunteer on Mondays and Fridays...&quot; Somehow, he was more embarrassed about it than usual. Perhaps there was something in the air...</p><p>&quot;Oh, cool. One of my friends usually goes too! He can't now though, he's a great cook!&quot; Luffy smiled. &quot;You should meet him, you'll like him. ACTUALLY, you should meet all my friends!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wait, no-&quot;</p><p>It was too late, Luffy started dialing someone.</p><p>&quot;Hey, Zoro!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, of course I know what time it is.&quot; Luffy looked back at Law rolling his eyes as if to say &quot;can you believe this guy?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Luffy-ya.&quot; Law whisper yelled. &quot;Hang up.&quot;</p><p>The younger only waved him away. &quot;I wanna bring Torao on our next hangout.&quot;</p><p>&quot;. . .&quot;</p><p>&quot;Really? Cool!&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Aha... yeah, no, it's gonna be fine. He'll be cool with that.&quot; The firefighter turned to wink at the doctor and all the latter could do was gawk at him in a whirlwind of emotions.</p><p>When the phone call was over, Luffy jumped in Law's car and waited for the other to get to the soup kitchen.</p><p>The firefighter was an absolute mess in the kitchen and kept distracting all the volunteers ehen another task was given to him as he quickly made friends with anyone in a hearing proximity.</p><p>Law was stuck in the kitchen cutting vegitables, forced to listen to Luffy laugh with the people that were supposed to be cleaning the floors beyond the thin wall.</p><p>His friend wasn't even there that day. At least then, he could have had some kind of comfort in his calm presence.</p><p>The sound of a truck stopping out back made him snap out of his musings. He turned to see Robin and her husband enter with the products and donated food from different establishments.</p><p>&quot;Hello, Robin. Franky.&quot; He greeted.</p><p>&quot;Hello, Mr Surgeon.&quot; She smiled and looked at her husband as if they were sharing a joke.</p><p>&quot;Heyo Trafalgar!&quot; Franky had started being friendlier to Law after a while and rhe doctor assumed his wife had something to do with it. But perhaps he might have been just that he needed time to warm up to people.</p><p>Luffy's laugh boomed through the walls once more and Robin's eyebrows raised ever the slightest. &quot;You've invited a friend?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not... exactly. He invited himself and-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Torao!&quot; Luffy pushed the doors open, waltzing in with a big grin. &quot;You have no idea what I-&quot; He stopped in his tracks, staring at the couple.</p><p>The couple stared back. Well... Robin was looking at him, amazed while Franky had his jaw hanging.</p><p>&quot;Robin! Franky!&quot; He dropped everything and ran, full speed to leap at them. Law fully expected them to drop him or fall from the impact but no such thing happened. In fact, Robin - being the closer one in proximity, caught him with no problem, even as he wrapped his arms around her and started moving as if he was a bug crawling around to find levarage. The doctor watched in confusion as his alley jumped from one person to the other, looking more creature than human. Franky laughed along and tried catching him like a cat, only for Luffy to keep readjusting, before he ended up hugging him as if on a piggyback ride.</p><p>&quot;Whatcha doing here, ya little freak?&quot; Franky tried, and failed, to strain his neck backwards and look at the other man.</p><p>&quot;I'm here with Torao! Duh.&quot;</p><p>Robin got a complicated look before she seemed to snap back to reality. &quot;Well, isn't that lovely.&quot;</p><br><br><br><br>",
            
                "<h2>Chapter 11</h2><p>Law's hands were shaking. He looked down at them - the tattooed letters ironically spelling &quot;D E A T H&quot; twice over. His breathing was ragged and uneven.</p><p>&quot;Hey,&quot; a large hand was placed on his shoulder. And although he recognized the voice and the touch, he still cringed away. &quot;I really think you should go home.&quot; Bepo gave him a small smile.</p><p>&quot;No- no- I just needed five minutes. I'm fine.&quot; Trafalgar stood up and straightened out his coat.&quot; He reached for his cup to drink the rest of his coffee. It was cold...</p><p>&quot;Law... it's been an hour.&quot;</p><p>Unbelieving, he turned to the clock to see that his friend was right. &quot;What...&quot; He murmured to himself.</p><p>&quot;Law.&quot; Bepo's soft eyes tried to narrow in a stern look. It did not affect Law but it clearly communicated how the nurse felt about the situation. &quot;Go home. Try to sleep... You did all you could.&quot;</p><p>After a beat of silence, the doctor rubbed his face and sighed deeply. &quot;Yeah...&quot; He had tried to compose himself as best as he could, ignoring the last part that Bepo said. &quot;I'll clock out...&quot; He shoved his hands in his pockets just to get them to stop shaking.</p><p>Law got to his car in the parking lot. He watched the sunrise in the reflection of the sunrise in the glass of the front seat. Maybe he wasn't in the right headspace to drive. before he realised it, he felt his feet drag him to the closest bus stop.</p><p>His hands kept on fidgeting with his fingers - tracing the letters on his knuckles. The same tattoos he got to remind himself not to make mistakes and what they could cost him. He allowed his brain to shut down until it was time to get off the bus. He walked the excruciating however many minutes to his current living residence. He had to hold the key with both hands to stop it from shaking and put it into the key hole.</p><p>Once inside, he allowed himself to breakdown. Finally.</p><p>His breath was shallow and fast, he could feel himself sweat like an animal, on all fours, heaving like a mutt.</p><p>Waiting to be put down.</p><p>He felt cold fingers wrap around his throat, adding pressure to it, restricting the blood flow to his head enough to numb him back to the present. He recognised it was his own boney fingers.</p><p>Fucking hell...</p><p>How pathetic was this? He couldn't even get past the door to have a panic attack...</p><p>With whatever clarity he possessed, he started mentally reassigning himself little tasks.</p><p>Take off your shoes. Good. Now go to the kitchen. Well done. Pour yourself a glass of water. Drink without choking. Great. Try not to think about the innocent life you couldn't save. Don't look at your bloodstained hands that have only caused pain inside the surgery room and outside of it.</p><p>A sound of glass shattering on the ground startled him and he could feel his socks getting wet.</p><p>God damn it! What kind of dysfunctional adult was he if he couldn't even drink a fucking water without fucking it up! He should have died with Cora-san when he had the chance.</p><p>He knelt down and started picking up the pieces with his bare hands. Little cuts forming on his hands, finally, he started scooping up the water but it only made it muddy and reddish. Like the idiot he was.</p><p>In a moment of weakness. Desperation. He picked up his phone and pressed the call button.</p><p>He listened to the beeps. One, two, three, and then -</p><p>&quot;Hey, Torao!&quot;</p><p>What the hell was he doing? Hang up! HANG UP!</p><p>&quot;Hello, I was- &quot; he cleared his throat, trying not to let his voice crack. &quot;Could you come over for- well, there's a couple of things I'd like to go through.&quot;</p><p>That's right. Make excuses and reasons to trick people into being around you.</p><p>&quot;Oh! I'd love to but I can't today!&quot; Luffy sounded like he was moving around, doing other things while he eas talking.</p><p>&quot;I... really?&quot; He didn't have work. Law was sure. He had the firefighter's schedule, he was supposed to be free. Not that he deserved the comfort from him.</p><p>&quot;We can go out next week though. I have an anniversary thing.&quot;</p><p>A distant voice shouted at Luffy to &quot;go&quot;. God, when had Law not been a burden.</p><p>&quot;Sorry, Torao, I gotta go!&quot; Luffy hung up before Law could say anything else.</p><p>Leaving his phone on the floor, he stood up and went to the bathroom to clean his cuts. He saw himself in the mirror. Abominable.</p><p>The sound of the running water was his only companion as his thoughts spiraled. The fact that even the man who used to be obsessed with him didn't want to do anything with him was pretty telling.</p><p>Law allowed himself to crawl into his sheets up into a ball and cry himself to sleep. He woke up in the middle of the night, dehydrated, with puffy eyes and a headache. Forcing himself to go back to sleep, he eventually dozed off again.</p><p>A couple of more unfortunate rouses soured his already hellish night. At some point, presumably the morning, Law found himself with covering his head with a cover to block out the sun.</p><p>But the sun always had it's way to find him.</p><p>His awakening was accompanied by a pair of footsteps. Unfortunately, he recognised the sound. He recognised the dip of the mattress, the weight of an arm that touched his shoulder. And if Law squeezed his eyes tight enough, he could imagine it was Cora.</p><p>&quot;Torao...&quot; Luffy's voice was gentler than expected. &quot;I know your not sleeping.&quot; He opened the blanket to watch Law slowly open his eyes -red and wet.</p><p>Luffy climbed in under the blanket, close to Law, faces close, just looking at each other. The firefighter just stood there under the protection of the covers, waiting. Quiet.</p><p>&quot;I killed a little girl yesterday.&quot; Law finally said. He could feel himself tear up again. &quot;I was holding her heart in my hands. It was- it was one of mine. And it was defective.&quot;</p><p>Luffy's hands took Laws into his own and the doctor noticed he had been trembling.</p><p>&quot;I gave her a defective heart and I didn't even know which one it was... Now- now she's dead because I failed.&quot; His breath hitched.</p><p>&quot;She got to live a few more months, maybe years, because of you.&quot; The certainty in his voice was almost contagious.</p><p>&quot;But she dies on my- my operating table.&quot;</p><p>Luffy pulled Law into himself. A firm and soft caress.</p><br><br><br><br>",

Maybe he wasn't in the right headspace to drive. before he realised it, he felt his feet drag him to the closest bus stop.</p><p>His hands kept on fidgeting with his fingers - tracing the letters on his knuckles. The same tattoos he got to remind himself not to make mistakes and what they could cost him. He allowed his brain to shut down until it was time to get off the bus. He walked the excruciating however many minutes to his current living residence. He had to hold the key with both hands to stop it from shaking and put it into the key hole.</p><p>Once inside, he allowed himself to breakdown. Finally.</p><p>His breath was shallow and fast, he could feel himself sweat like an animal, on all fours, heaving like a mutt.</p><p>Waiting to be put down.</p><p>He felt cold fingers wrap around his throat, adding pressure to it, restricting the blood flow to his head enough to numb him back to the present. He recognised it was his own boney fingers.</p><p>Fucking hell...</p><p>How pathetic was this? He couldn't even get past the door to have a panic attack...</p><p>With whatever clarity he possessed, he started mentally reassigning himself little tasks.</p><p>Take off your shoes. Good. Now go to the kitchen. Well done. Pour yourself a glass of water. Drink without choking. Great. Try not to think about the innocent life you couldn't save. Don't look at your bloodstained hands that have only caused pain inside the surgery room and outside of it.</p><p>A sound of glass shattering on the ground startled him and he could feel his socks getting wet.</p><p>God damn it! What kind of dysfunctional adult was he if he couldn't even drink a fucking water without fucking it up! He should have died with Cora-san when he had the chance.</p><p>He knelt down and started picking up the pieces with his bare hands. Little cuts forming on his hands, finally, he started scooping up the water but it only made it muddy and reddish. Like the idiot he was.</p><p>In a moment of weakness. Desperation. He picked up his phone and pressed the call button.</p><p>He listened to the beeps. One, two, three, and then -</p><p>&quot;Hey, Torao!&quot;</p><p>What the hell was he doing? Hang up! HANG UP!</p><p>&quot;Hello, I was- &quot; he cleared his throat, trying not to let his voice crack. &quot;Could you come over for- well, there's a couple of things I'd like to go through.&quot;</p><p>That's right. Make excuses and reasons to trick people into being around you.</p><p>&quot;Oh! I'd love to but I can't today!&quot; Luffy sounded like he was moving around, doing other things while he was talking.</p><p>&quot;I... really?&quot; He didn't have work. Law was sure. He had the firefighter's schedule, he was supposed to be free. Not that he deserved the comfort from him.</p><p>&quot;We can go out next week though. I have an anniversary thing.&quot;</p><p>A distant voice shouted at Luffy to &quot;go&quot;. God, when had Law not been a burden.</p><p>&quot;Sorry, Torao, I gotta go!&quot; Luffy hung up before Law could say anything else.</p><p>Leaving his phone on the floor, he stood up and went to the bathroom to clean his cuts. He saw himself in the mirror. Abominable. He never recognised himself - like a stranger looking back at him, he snarled at the ugly face staring back.</p><p>The sound of the running water was his only companion as his thoughts spiraled. The fact that even the man who used to be obsessed with him didn't want to do anything with him was pretty telling. Maybe it was better that Luffy didn't want to come over. Seeing one's &quot;business partner&quot; like this could have been fatal.</p><p>Law allowed himself to crawl into his sheets up into a ball and cry himself to sleep. He woke up in the middle of the night, dehydrated, with puffy eyes and a headache. Forcing himself to go back to sleep, he eventually dozed off again.</p><p>A couple of more unfortunate rouses soured his already hellish night. At some point, presumably the morning, Law found himself with covering his head with a cover to block out the sun.</p><p>With no little disdain, the doctor started getting ready for his shift. He could only hope Bepo wouldn't scold him too much for not taking a day off.</p><p>But if he had to take days off or call in sick every time someone died on his operating table, he would be the most unprofessional surgeon in his field.</p><p>He washed his face, cupping his hands to make a puddle water to splash in his face. The little girl's heart in his hands was almost the size of the water he was holding. He opened the cupboard, knowing he wouldn't have the stomach to eat anything, but if he didn't force himself, he probably would go on all day on nothing but coffee.</p><p>The spoon mixing the oats with the hot water. He dropped in a few berries to stain the tasteless mush. It sloshed and swirled, reddening like the child's organs as the monitors were piercing his ears with alarms.</p><p>Law left his bowl on the counter, losing the last bit of his appetite.</p><p>A knock on his door snapped him out of his thoughts.</p><p>Who could bother him before work?</p><p>Irritated and already heading out, the doctor opened the door.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>&quot;Hi, Torao!&quot; A bright grin greeted him.</p><p>&quot;Luffy-ya. I'm leaving for work just now. Perhaps find another day to bug me.&quot; Law shooed the shorter man away from the exit and locked after himself.</p><p>&quot;I was just jogging near the neighbourhood and wanted to see you.&quot; Luffy said as if he hadn't heard what Law told him.</p><p>&quot;Luffy, you live more than thirty kilometres from here...&quot; the doctor took in the appearance of the other - sweaty and a bit out of breath. Lost in the way the younger's eyes seemed to track his own, and the thought of</p><p>&quot;Really? I didn't know it was that far.&quot; A laugh.</p><p>When Law ignored him again in favour of locking up and walking towards his car, Luffy to his side once more.</p><p>The doctor opened his car door, looking at Luffy for a long moment - rooted three steps away. He seemed to forget to look away. How morbidly ironic it was that it was so easy to feel normal next to Luffy.</p><p>&quot;Fine.&quot; Law sighed. &quot;Get in.&quot;</p><p>The firefighter's face lit up and he sat in the front. Starting the engine, Law gave himself a second to stabilize himself. The drive was nothing too out of the ordinary, if one considered Luffy touching every surface and opening all the compartments in the car as ordinary. He</p><br><br><br><br>",
            
                "<h2>Chapter 11.2</h2><p>Luffy looked at the pictures with a scrunched-up brow. &quot;Why does she dress like that?&quot;</p><p>Mid-sentence, Law stopped to look back at his partner in crime. &quot;Where you paying attention to anything I was saying until now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not really, I got distracted by this picture.&quot; He took it to show it to the doctor. &quot;Why did she dress like a kid like that? Or... I can't tell if it's childish or grandma-like. She's old, right? Cause she's really short...&quot;</p><p>The doctor sighed. &quot;Yes, she's one year older than you, she just has dwarfism.&quot; He looked at the picture of their target - a baggy polka dot dress, a hat with animal ears, and a coat. &quot;I don't know why she's- why does it even matter what she's wearing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Franky says it's super uncool to treat people different when they're different.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He's right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So it's good that we're still killing her cause she won't be excluded. Right?&quot; Luffy beamed.</p><p>&quot;I-&quot; Trafalgar stumbled for words. &quot;What?&quot; Is all he managed.</p><p>&quot;Well, if we speared he only cause she had the thing you said it would be bad because we're not holding her up to the same standard, right?&quot;</p><p>Blinking at him, Law was speechless. &quot;Bad people are bad people, Luffy-ya. Almost nothing will excuse that.&quot;</p><br><br><br><br>",

                "<h2>Chapter 12</h2><p>The day was sunny and warm, the way that made one's skin feel little prickles when first exposed to the cloudless sky. That was the exact reason why Doctor Trafalgar Law made sure to stay inside. Marco was on his lunch break but went to the terrace to eat and Bepo had made Law promise that he would eat lunch.</p><p>Initially, he would go to the diner where Penguin and Sanji worked, but he didn't think he could face the blond after how Luffy was acting in the restaurant. Law didn't even know that was Blackleg's restaurant...</p><p>Law looked at the glass doors from the lobby. It was just too bright.</p><p>&quot;Hey, doc!&quot; A faint voice called for him.</p><p>The surgeon turned his head to see Ace's wheelchair being pushed by none other than Luffy. They were coming his way.</p><p>&quot;Hello.&quot; He nodded, eyes going up to Luffy, who gave him such a bright smile it made his stomach flip unpleasantly. The doctor looked back at the older brother. &quot;What brings you here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm waiting for Marco to get my check-up.&quot; Ace shrugged. &quot;How've you been though? We haven't seen each other in ages!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hopefully we won't see each other often, as it seems you often find your way on my operation table.&quot;</p><p>Ace laughed. &quot;How's your week been then doc?&quot;</p><p>Luffy's smile seemed to widen if that were even possible.</p><p>&quot;Unremarkable.&quot; The surgeon cleared his throat, uncomfortable...</p><p>A frown replaced Luffy's grin. &quot;That's not true! Just yesterday I made you cum five times just from kissing and dry humping!&quot; He huffed and Law could feel his skin prickle as his face started burning.</p><p>From the chair, Ace looked up with furrowed brows and a hanging jaw. After an awkward amount of silence of Ace staring at his little brother, Luffy glaring at Law and the doctor's eyes flickering between the brothers, Ace uttered a single &quot;dude.&quot;</p><p>Luffy's face relaxed from whatever pout he had to look at his brother. &quot;I didn't wanna push him too fast, I've only blown him.&quot; He said as if he was making defensive excuses.</p><p>Ace - still in shock looked at the doctor, and did a double take to his brother and back. And then he started laughing hysterically. Interrupted by coughs and wheezes, he did his best to normalize his breathing while still laughing.</p><p>&quot;Lu, you can't say that shit so casually!&quot; He said mid-laugh. &quot;Good luck, doc.&quot; He peaked at Trafalgar, who at the time was hoping to get swallowed by the earth.</p><p>In civilized situations, the surgeon's fight-or-flight instincts often chose freeze. As soon as he realized he had nailed himself in the spot, he turned to walk away in shame. He couldn't deal with this at the moment. One brother was far too much anyway.</p><p>He could hear their voices calling for him to come back but Law couldn't be happier to ignore them.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Rumors and conspiracies from decades ago about the dead city | Urban legends on the table</p><p>&#55357;&#57313; Jewelry B &#12300;&#10004; &#7515;&#7497;&#691;&#7590;&#7584;&#7590;&#7497;&#7496;&#12301;(Subscribe)</p><p>[4.15k subscribers] [&#55357;&#56397;38k][&#55357;&#56398;][&#10150; Share][...]</p><p>&quot;Hello guys and welcome to another mukbang video! Today I'm so excited because we got fried chicken covered in melted cheese, I also got this chocolate fountain to work with cheddar! We have some grilled ribs in barbeque sauce and more meat here - There are ten different types of kebabs - doner kebab, urfa kebab, chapli kebab, and iskender kebab. All from an authentic Arabastian restaurant that I'll link in the description!&quot;</p><p>A girl with pink hair and golden earrings gestured to the pile of food in front of her.</p><p>&quot;But before we get started, let's thank &quot;Sora: Online Surfer Games&quot; for sponsoring me.&quot; She laughed.</p><p>The screen displays computer graphics for several characters, moving and interacting with the environment.</p><p>&quot;Sora: OSG&quot; is an open-world rpg game you can play with your friends online. Not gonna lie, when I played it first I was sceptical, but now I'm actually so hooked! You collect items and upgrade them, you can form a superhero troop to defeat harder bosses, if you're a loser, and there's a ranking system that updates depending on the xp you collect! I'm in the top thirty world wide by the way. You can also send your friends extra diamonds and coins as well as gifts. So feel free to send me stuff.&quot; Another laugh sounds through the video as there is a pink character on screen shown collecting coins and trinkets in the game. &quot;If you use my promo code &quot;Jewels Bon/promo&quot; you get a head start of a pair of sky-walk boots and two-hundred coins on top of your initial build!&quot;</p><p>The screen changed again - showing Bonny and the food once more.</p><p>&quot;Now that that's out of the way, let's get started.&quot; She grabbed the doner kebab. &quot;I'm going to be very honest - this is my third doner. I had a little pre-snack before recording and these are sooo good!&quot; Bonny took off the wrapping and bit into her meal. &quot;Ah, look at how tender the meat it!&quot; She showed it off to the camera. &quot;It also smells so good, you guys should be jealous.&quot; With a few more big bites, the girl finished whole thing and took the next. &quot;If I run out of food in the middle of the story, I have backup - I ordered more just in case. Today we're going into the urban legend so wide spread that the ministry of justice had to publicly deny. That's right, we're talking about the amber lead and the burning of Flevance!&quot;</p><p>Chewing and talking didn't seem like a problem to the girl, as she was already on her way to her fourth meat-based food. &quot;So, first off a quick disclaimer - Flevance was an actual city way back when, but it was like a couple of decades ago, and it got abandoned because of industrialisation and what-not. But what if I tell you that there are people who claimed that Flevance just until recently? I tried my best to find when it all started but all I could trace back was an interview Morgans did for news coo about a mental hospital or something. He did a brief interview with some of the patients and one of them was a man who kept insisting his wife and child were in Flevance and the ones who claim that are his family now - the ones who visit him and pay for his stay are imposters. The thing is - he's a lunatic and no one cares. But he wasn't the only one, there is a very prominent</p><br><br><br><br>",
                
                "<h2>Chapter 12.1???</h2><p>Luffy's hands slid up his shirt and grabbed onto every patch of skin.</p><p>Looking down on himself, he saw his skin - like in those horrifying months of his life where every breath could have been his last. And with the flood of dread, crashing onto him like angry waves upon the abused sharp edges of an abandoned beach. But before the horror could retake ahold of his soul, a pure white hand - so bright it practically glowed, slid up his spin to rest on his left peck. Law could feel his heart beat like the drums of a song he didn't remember knowing.</p><p>A familiar laugh - carefree and chilling to the bone, drummed in tandem.</p><p>The surgeon looked up to see Luffy - no, Nika! With white hair and clouds around his shoulders, the bloodthirst in his eyes flashed with hungry joy. Terrifying and exhilarating. And then he started moving again. The buck of his hips, feeling far too real, far too good. When he leaned in, the world shifted in a haze and intoxication. Nika's mouth brushed the surgeon's ears and the lust started to pool inside him. &quot;To-ra-ooo&quot; the man said, not too far from a song, pronouncing his name like every syllable was a secret too good for the world. &quot;You are my last meal, Toraooo,&quot; he breathed out and lowered his body. His mouth started exploring the surgeon's chest, gentle at first but then it got too much. Law had to look away. With a brain melting moan, he jolted back to see what Nika was going. He felt like patches of his being were liquifying.</p><p>Sharp teeth sunk into flesh - more akin to sludge as it dripped from Nika's mouth. One by one, the white patches on his skin were devoured by the ancient god. The eye contact never breaking made the surgeon feel like he was swimming in pleasure. The thrumping of the drums never stopped but he knew this was good. He wasn't sure how he knew, but he did.</p><p>There was something intoxicating about seeing himself between Luffy's teeth. Explosions prickled under his skin and his brain was practically throbbing with need.</p><p>Wait... Luffy? Nika?</p><p>&quot;Okay, one last thing.&quot; Luffy leaned into his chest. His hand pressed onto the doctor's chest.</p><p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Law heard himself saying.</p><p>But... no. No! He wanted to say &quot;No.&quot; Coke on, God damn it! NO!</p><p>&quot;YES!&quot; His mouth moved on its own, with a moan that made the drums sound even louder.</p><p>Nails dug into his chest and he smelled the blood before he heard the bones of his ribcage cracking. A metallic taste flooded his mouth. Law felt frozen as he watched Luffy digging through his chest like a bloodhound looking for something in the ground.</p><p>The drums suddenly stopped and the only thing Trafalgar could hear was a slow heartbeat.</p><p>Luffy stopped and a confused expression made its way on his face. His brows furrowed as he pulled away.</p><p>What...? Law looked down but he couldn't see what the other was seeing.</p><p>He tried moving his hands to touch at his chest, to get any kind of clue as to what was going on. But he was frozen. His eyes darted up to watch Luffy slowly lift his head to meet Law's gaze. He had an ugly scowl, disgust.</p><p>&quot;Where is it?&quot; He asked.</p><p>Law snapped from it, reaching into his chest to find it was empty. There was nothing there. He knew how insides felt like... where was it?</p><p>&quot;Yeah, Law. Where is it?&quot; A voice asked behind him, sending a cold shiver down his spine. He turned to see Donquxhote Doflamingo with the same hole on the left side of his chest. He looked angry.</p><p>&quot;Did you lose it?&quot; Luffy asked.</p><p>And this time, when Law looked at him it was... he was wearing a feathered black coat and the same clown makeup that haunted him.</p><p>.</p><p>Trafalgar's eyes shot open.</p><p>Slowly standing up, his shirt clung to his back with sweat. His boxers stuck uncomfortably to him.</p><p>Great. Now his nightmares doubled down as wet dreams. Just... great.</p><p>Unconsciously, Law rubbed at his chest, feeling out the beating of his heart.</p><p>Tilting his head down, he held his hands - trembling. To calm himself down, he tried counting his breaths. It didn't help much but nothing much helped with him. Well... perhaps other than Luffy annoying him, but almost nothing was as distracting as he could be.</p><p>Realizing he was smiling at the thought, he quickly scowled it away.</p><p>He was getting far too comfortable. This was business. Purely business. Self preservation.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Law looked at the clock - a few minutes before his first alarm. As a Sunday, he knew that he had a nine hour shift, probably as good as it would get.</p><p>Stepping into the shower, he started thinking about the more important things. The things he had to think about. Turning the water on cold - shocked his system into the present. No distractions, no nightmares, only the plan.</p><p>Considering that he would be taking the graveyard shift, he asked the nurse on duty to be on call for the first two hours. &quot;A date,&quot; was an excuse he never thought he would use but he was starting to regret it. Provided with all the markings that Luffy left it was hard not to appreciate the way anyone rarely asked questions after describing it as a &quot;small dinner at home&quot;.</p><br><br><br><br>",
            
                "<h2>Chapter 16?</h2> <p>Sanji was pacing the back of the diner. He was on his sixth cigarette. It had been no more than five minutes. The fingers of his free hand were gripping his hair. He lit his seventh one with a deep inhale to finish the cigarette. The cook fumbled his phone from the greasy apron and dialed the number.</p><p>&quot;Now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Zoro's voice sounded muffled and rough.</p><p>&quot;Now is the time. We tell him now!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cook, what the hell?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come by the diner and pick me the fuck up! Stop taking naps on the job!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Piss off, curly.&quot; A rustling and a groan, after the sound of something like crackling of bones came through the line. &quot;Be there in fifteen.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Big stretch, huh, marimo?&quot; He couldn't help but smirk. Sanji was grateful for the fact that some things stayed the same. Some things gave a grounding sense of normalcy.</p><p>A moment of silence brought the blond the satisfaction that would keep him from driving himself insane until he waited. &quot;It was a damn good nap.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Use the GPS that Nami got you-&quot; The cook started saying but Zoro had already hung up halfway through. &quot;Bastard.&quot; Sanji frowned.</p><p>He clicked his cracked screen a couple of times before holding the phone back to his ear. A few beeps sounded before the call was accepted.</p><p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Sanji simulated a smile.</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah she told me. And, you know, I can come by and pick it up.&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p>It took twenty-three minutes for Kuina's SUV to arrive at the diner. The cook knew that because he was counting. He didn't bother telling the boss where he was going, the other cook in the kitchen would handle it.</p><p>With a quick, &quot;good luck, Penguin&quot;, he left and jogged to the car outside.</p><p>&quot;Kuina's not with you, right?&quot; He asked, looking through the backseat windows.</p><p>Zoro raised an eyebrow. &quot;Do I look like an idiot?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Do you really want the honest answer?&quot;</p><p>Zoro just tisked and nodded at the blind to get in.</p><p>&quot;You want to tell Luffy?&quot; It was a question. And yet, neither of them wondered what the he would say.</p><p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright.&quot; The mosshead started driving. &quot;But this is a bad idea.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is that why you took Kuina's car instead of your two-wheeler death machine?&quot; It was like a life line. The way the blond tried to cling onto their usual banter as if they weren't going to ruin their day, week, or even month.</p><p>&quot;That's actually a really cool title for Yubashiri.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You named your bike after the sword you broke? The same one that got you hospitalized for a month?&quot; Sanji blinked, dumbly.</p><p>Zoro only looked at him smugly, with the attitude of someone who had just gotten the biggest compliment for their wits.</p><p>Finally, the hum of the engine died down in front of the complex where Luffy lived.</p><p>From the moment Sanji got out of his car, he felt a shiver down his spine. He looked back at Zoro, who had a distant and odd look. He was gazing in a single point far away.</p><p>&quot;What is it?&quot; Sanji asked, voice lowered.</p><p>Zoro's eyebrows furrowed a bit. &quot;I just have a feeling someone's watching.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Us?&quot;</p><p>&quot;In general.&quot;</p><p>Under any other circumstance, Sanji would have retorted with something snappy or sarcastic, disregarding the ridiculous statement as Zoro's professional defect as a PI. But this was no normal circumstance. He couldn't afford to disregard it.</p><p>&quot;Let's go.&quot; Was all he could manage to say.</p><p>They walked up to Luffy's door. It was already open and the younger man was excitedly waiting for his friends.</p><p>&quot;Zoroooo!&quot; He shouted, running at full speed, and flung himself onto Zoro's neck. &quot;Sanji!&quot; His hand reached out to grab the cook by the shirt and yanked him to crash into the hug.</p><p>&quot;Ah, fuck.&quot; He winced a bit in pain. &quot;Luffy, please, let go-&quot;</p><p>Zoro was holding up one of the firefighter's legs up, preventing either of the from falling. Luffy stretched out his other leg and accidentally kicked Sanji in the stomach while trying to wrap it around him as well. The cook bent over with the pain, making it easier for Luffy to grab him by his collar and pull him in the hug.</p><p>&quot;There we go!&quot; Luffy laughed. &quot;OH! I'm so happy you guys came! I was so boooored here alone!&quot; He jumped off and kicked the door shut. &quot;Uh... did anyone see you?&quot; The words sounded whistled rather than spoken.</p><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nothing, nothing.&quot; He waved his hand. &quot;Come on guys!&quot; He started stomping further into the apartment. &quot;I got your cookbook right here, but if you guys stay a little-&quot; They followed him into the livingroom. &quot;We could like, I dunno, play something? How long was it since we just hung out? The tree of us, I mean?&quot; There were empty, old pizza boxes stacked in the corner, the couch had a duvet - crinkled up and fallen off one of the sides, the cushions were on the floor and around the coffee table that still had Ace and Luffy's names carved on it alongside a bunch of other intentional and accidental indents and stains. Luffy flopped himself on one of the cushions and grabbed an old controller. It was connected to an Xbox 360 that looked like it was fighting for dear life. He pressed the start button with the naked toe of his foot. It started making loud and rattling noises. Luffy frowned and kicked the noises simmered down into a constant, low hum.</p><p>Sanji laughed nervously. &quot;Uhm. No, we're not here for that, Luffy-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know, I haven't forgotten.&quot; He said nonchalantly, not looking away from the taller table on the other end of the room. &quot;The book's there.&quot;</p><p>Sanji turned to take it.</p><p>&quot;Damn, I can't believe you're still using Ace's old Xbox.&quot; Zoro smirked, looking at it like it was an ancient artifact.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, it makes funny noises sometimes but it works!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Zoro.&quot; Sanji hissed at the mosshead before turning to Luffy with softer, almost mournful eyes. &quot;Luffy, we're here to talk about something serious...&quot;</p><p>Putting down his controller, the firefighter looked at the blond with the unblinking wide eyes of neutrality that could send shivers down anyone's spine. Anyone who wasn't already used to it.</p><p>&quot;This Torao- uh, this Trafalgar Law guy of yours...&quot; Sanji had to pause. He took a breath, like a shot of pain, quick, short and with a grimace. Because there was no way was Luffy making that face on purpose. His cold and concentrated look had immediately morphed into a small smiled with slightly risen eyebrows. For fuck's sake, even his pupils widened. God fucking damn it.</p><p>&quot;Sanji, what's wrong. Why are you makign that face? Are you hurt?&quot; Luffy tilted his head.</p><p>&quot;No, no. Sorry I- we just have bad news and it's hard for us to tell you this...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Did something happen to Traffy!?&quot; He jumped up in panic.</p><p>&quot;No, as far as I know, he's physically okay. it's just... how much do you know about him?&quot;</p><p>Luffy giggled. &quot;Oh, I know stuff. Why? You guys wanna invite him over? I can-&quot; He started to look around for his phone but stopped. &quot;Actually, not right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You broke up or something?&quot; Zoro crossed his arms.</p><p>&quot;...or something.&quot; Luffy's eyes darted on the ground.</p><p>Okay. Good. Good, right? Sanji's mind raced a bit to mach his heart's palpitations. This was probably good, this way they're already broken up and he might burn the bridge faster... or is it worse- Deciding not to dwell on it too much.</p><p>&quot;There's some stuff we found about him...&quot; Sanji looked at Zoro for backup.</p><p>&quot;Luffy, has he told you about the Donquehotes?&quot; The moment that Zoro asked the question, Luffy's eyebrows started falling, inhumanly slow, into a glare.</p><p>For a moment, if Sanji didn't know any better, he could say that he was about to jump Zoro.</p><p>&quot;If there's something he wants to tell me, he will.&quot; Luffy looked back at Sanji. &quot;I trust him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As much as I hate to agree with the cook, Luffy, this is serious, we think that he might be dangerous.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don't care. Stop looking into my boyfriend!&quot; His voice was raising. &quot;I trust him! And if you trust me, you'll leave it alone!&quot; His hands articulated in the air in anger.</p><p>Sanji's mouth opened to speak but before he could say anything, he felt a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Zoro nodded, more to Sanji than to Luffy.</p><p>&quot;I think you should leave.&quot;</p><p>Sanji pierced his lips. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p></p><p>The very moment the car's slammed shut, Sanji turned to Zoro. &quot;I think-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don't even know what I was-&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Curly-&quot; Zoro was gripping the wheel, his forehead hitting it.</p><p>&quot;We can-&quot;</p><p>&quot;We can't just break into his house.&quot;</p><p>For a moment the blond stayed quiet. Long enough for the other to have to turn around and see what was going on. Sanji was staring into the distance ahead. His hands were gripping his hair.</p><p>&quot;Zoro,&quot; barely above a whisper. &quot;We have to...&quot;</p><p></p><p>The drive to the doctor's house was silent except for the hum of the engine and the sound of tires on the road. In reality, Zoro didn't mind this. It wasn't some kind of moral line he wasn't willing to cross. He didn't care if they broke into someone's apartment. It's the exact type of morally gray thing Mihaek would scold him for when he worked in his department. The exact type of thing a private investigator had to do far too often.</p><p>&quot;Just stop a block or two away.&quot; Sanji tapped the other's forearm without looking at him. &quot;Yeah, like right there...&quot;</p><p>Zoro was worried more about crossing a line with Luffy.</p><p>&quot;What are you doing? We missed the house-&quot;</p><p>&quot;We're being followed.&quot; Zoro spared a glance in the rearview mirror. He was also worried about the cook.</p><p>&quot;Oh.&quot; The blond looked back. &quot;Shit...&quot; He muttered to himself.</p><p>Usually, twirly brows would notice these things before Zoro. He wasn't this jittery... usually. This &quot;two eight-hour shifts thing must really be draining him.</p><p>&quot;I'll lose them on the fork traffic light. Can you write down their number before that? My glasses are-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Sanji pulled out a pen and his pad from the diner. He stood there for a moment. Not writing anything down.</p><p>&quot;Curly? Did you get it?&quot; An urgency in Zoro's voice grew with the approaching traffic light.</p><p>&quot;No, I-&quot;</p><p>Fuck. Too late now. The light went from green to yellow, around twenty meters ahead of them. Zoro slammed the gas and went from the right lane into the far left, barely making the turn before another vehicle slammed into them. Whoever was following them got stuck on the red light and onslot of cars blocking off the road they went.</p><p>&quot;Don't fucking tell me you didn't get their license plate.&quot; Zoro gripped the wheel and bit his tongue.</p><p>&quot;I-&quot;</p><p>&quot;YOU HAD ONE JOB CURLY!&quot;</p><p>&quot;THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LICENSE PLATE!&quot;</p><p>&quot;... what? what do you mean?&quot;</p><p>Sanji's hands started running and scratching through his scalp again. &quot;There was nothing it was- there was no emblem or number- nothing!&quot;</p><p>&quot;If you didn't see it, you don't have-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm not lying!&quot;</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>&quot;Now what...&quot;</p><p>Zoro furrowed his brow. The more he thought about it, the less he liked whatever the hell this was. With a sigh, he gave in. &quot;Fine. Me and Kuina will take it up officially. As a case.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, keep the lady out of this!&quot; Sanji snapped back, sounding almost normal.</p><p>&quot;She's stronger than both of us-&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that, idiot. It's not about that. It's just, this is Luffy. I want to be here. I need to... I...&quot;</p><p>Fuck, he sounded miserable.</p><p>&quot;Fine. I give up with you. You're such a pris too! Damn you, cook.&quot; Zoro's words were snipped and chopped short like his patients - thinner and thinner with the more time that passed. We're stalking the doctor's house for a week and if nothing happens, we're stopping this. Got it?&quot;</p><p>Sanji looked so relieved that it could be mistaken with happiness. &quot;... thanks...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ew.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Up yours.&quot;</p><p>Almost back to normal.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Bepo nocked on the office door for the third time. No answer. With a heavy exhale and an even heavier suspicion, he pushed the door open.</p><p>He closed it carefully behind himself and walked up to Law. He had fallen asleep on his desk.</p><p>&quot;Doctor...&quot; He placed a hand on his shoulder. When there was no response, he tried again, shaking him very lightly. &quot;Doctor Trafalgar?&quot; Nothing. &quot;Law!&quot;</p><p>With a little jolt, the doctor straightened up in his seat. &quot;W- yes. Yes. Hello, Bepo.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey...&quot; He gave the doctor a small smile. &quot;There's a patient who's been waiting for at least fifteen minutes now...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right. Right, yes, of course.&quot; Law's eyebags were getting heavy again and his eyes were all read and irritated.</p><p>He must be staying up late. The nurse thought to himself.</p><p>&quot;Thank you, Bepo.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course! And you know,you haven't taken any sick days or holidays for the past decade, you have at least a month of free days buit up...&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's fine, Bepo, really. I just got rrally invested in a book last night and, uhm, I should have slept, I know.&quot;</p><p>The nerse gasped. &quot;Oh! I get ot! It's okay, I already know about Luffy, you don't have to code it for me!&quot; His smile stretched - genuin.</p><p>&quot;No, no. He's actually been ignoring me.&quot;</p><p>And it fell again.</p><p>&quot;What? Oh... &quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",

                "<h2>Chapter 21</h2> <p>...</p><p><br></p><p>Growing up as the eldest of two respected doctors, each in their own fields, involved a lot of scientific curiosity and revolving doors for sick people. Louh could have lied and said his morbidness and all together unsettling demeanor around death and the dying was because of death's keenness towards his loved ones. But he had been a weird kid before losing it all.</p><p>By the time he was eight, he had already seen his town get slaughtered and his whole family murdered in front of his eyes.</p><p>By the time he turned thirteen, he could pride himself on twenty-eight failed runaway attempts, being kicked out of six hospitals and two children's homes and five orphanages. He was like a leper who everyone pretended to care about but never wanted near or to acknowledge. And with the little that people knew about the white lead disease, he might as well have been.</p><p>The first time in four years that someone ever&nbsp;<em>saw</em>&nbsp;him was in one of the small hospitals where he hadn't been blacklisted yet. He had a routine, yearly checkup to make sure that he was still dying.</p><p>The hospital staff was rushing him more than usual, getting him out in record time. It was pathetic how they tried to push him out but didn't even dare to touch him without gloves and hazmat suits.</p><p>&quot;We have a sponser visiting today, ehy were we cursed to have you here now!?&quot; The doctor clapped his hand in horror.</p><p>&quot;Alright, I'm leaving!&quot; He grumbled at the doctor. He was walking backwards</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>&quot;Just stay here, okay, kid? And don't make any noise, or I'll be mad at you forever!&quot;</p><p>The little kid's furrowed brows lifted at the center, frustration turning to worry. &quot;What if something happens to you?&quot; His fingers fidgeted with the sleeves of his jacket. He was afraid to look at Cora's face. Afraid that he would also look scared. And if the only adult who was on his side was as scared of him, how was he supposed to feel? He feared that he would have to grow up faster just when he started feeling like being a kid was okay.</p><p>But when he looked up, Corazon had the goofiest smile, his missing tooth was so obvious like that and his eyes were practically slits with how much teeth he was showing. Law couldn't stop himself from laughing. &quot;Don't worry about it kid!&quot; He made a peace sign. &quot;Nothing's gonna happen. We still haven't made a snowman yet, yeah?&quot;</p><p>A hesitant smile made it on Law's face. &quot;Yeah.&quot; He nodded.</p><p>Cora started closing the door. &quot;And not a peep, no matter what you hear. Got it?&quot;</p><p>Law nodded.</p><p>He locked him in the cupboard, hiding the key in his pocket. Through the solid doors, all Law could do was hear the snow under Corazon's shoes crack. There was a gust of wind and a flicker of a lighter. Cora's voice muttered something, probably a curse, as he shuffled with his coat to put the lighter away again.</p><p>And finally - a second set of footsteps.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Thankfully, Law could push the old wooden door open and get to Cora's body. The snow helped with the wound. It was a superficial one and it turned out that clumsy man had just slipped and fell down. Doflamingo thought he had hit a vital organ and left him for dead. With the phone in Cora's phone, Trafalgar called an ambulance and they came just in time before they could get frost bite.</p><p>It took Cora a while to recover but he's fine now. Almost half an year for him to get out of the hospital and even then there were complications with his health because of the long time he laid in the snow. He moved overseas and found a small and warm village where the winters never have snow and the summers are unbearably hot. He sells lemons, oranges, tangerines for a living. He sometimes sends Law pictures of citrus fruits that look funny and Law would look at them and snort a laugh, but would never admit it...</p><p>It's not much of an exiting life. But it's a life.</p><p>He's like an old geezer now but just as big of an clumsy idiot as he was before.</p><p><em>But that's not what happened, was it?</em></p><p>No. It's not.</p><p><em>He didn't survive... did he...</em></p><p>He didn't.</p><p>He got shot directly in the heart. The police said that the killer probably walked over when he had fallen on the ground to shoot him two more times and make sure he was dead for good.</p><p>Cora lied. He was not fine and Law never got to build that snowman.&nbsp;</p><p>Law waited after the footsteps walked away. He waited and waited in hopes that it was Cora who would come back. Or maybe that he was pretending to be dead so he wouldn't be suspicious. But after nothing happened, he started calling for him.</p><p>&quot;Cora...?&quot; Unsure. &quot;Cora?&quot; Louder. &quot;Cora!!&quot; Louder! &quot;CORA! ANSWER ME!&quot; Angry. &quot;CORA PLEASE!!&quot; Angrier.&nbsp;</p><p>He was starting to thrash against the wooden doors. They always creaked but never broke. He tried and tried to pish them open but nothing happened. Finally, he noticed a crack in the back wall. He pushed so that the cupboard would fall on it's side - making the back wall the top. He laid on his back and started picking up. He kicked and kicked until he make a hole big enough to encourage him. Just a little more and he could squeeze out.</p><p>He rushed over to the body on the snow. Everything around him was red. The snow was soaked in blood and Cora still had that dumb smile on his face.</p><p>Law heled him. He held him and cried. &quot;Cora! Cora wake up! Please! This isn't funny! Please...&quot; He was shaking from the freezing cold and from his sobs. &quot;Please, dad... I can't lose you... you can't leave me alone, dad, please...&quot; His voice was cracked, desperation oozing from every word he spoke but there was no more delusions he could fool himself with. Even if he hadn't died from the gunshots, he would have died in the snow.</p><p><em>And there was no phone?</em></p><p>No phone. Law had to&nbsp;</p><p><br></p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",

                "<h2>Chapter 21.0</h2> <p>Right jab. Cross. Right hook. Left, left, right- kick, kick, kick, jab, kick-</p><p><em>His own brother-</em>&nbsp;another kick.&nbsp;<em>The good man who took care of a sick kid!</em>&nbsp;A stronger jab.&nbsp;<em>Someone so vile! It made him sick. When Law told him, so casually, he had to physically restrain him from going after him right then and there.</em></p><p>&quot;Give the punching bag a chance.&quot; An awkward laugh. &quot;I'm getting nervous for when we get in the ring.&quot;</p><p>Luffy barely regestered what Koby was saying. His head was still reeling from what Law told him.&nbsp;<em>&quot;I stayed in the&nbsp;crait&nbsp;in front of the safe house for what felt like hours, not really sure if it was safe to find Cora.&quot; It made Luffy smell that Mingo guy's blood in the air.</em></p><p><em>His own damned brother.</em></p><p>&quot;No. It's fine, wear the head thing.&quot; Luffy turned to Koby and tossed him a headguard. &quot;Come on, I need to fuck something up before Nami's party starts.&quot;</p><p>He didn't notice how concerned Koby looked. Stepping in, Luffy kept on chanting&nbsp;<em>Traffy&nbsp;wants to do it himself,&nbsp;Traffy&nbsp;wants to do it himself,</em>&nbsp;because it he was being honest, he was ready to march up to Mingo's foorstep as soon as he heard all of that. But killing naked wasn't really cool with all the cleaning Robin told him to do since last time, so he was kind of glad Totao talked him out of it.</p><p>&quot;So, uh,-&quot; Koby stepped in and took a fighting position. &quot;I was thinking about some things...&quot;</p><p><em>&quot;I can still see the red in the snow every time winter comes.&quot; Taffy's trembling voice never left the firefighter's mind.</em></p><p>A quick succession of punches, many of which were successfully dodged or defended by Kody. He took a side step and used the position and distraction of his opponent to try and strike him in the rips, missing by a hair.</p><p><em>&quot;It was so cold that even if he hadn't died from&nbsp;bloodloss, by the time that I got to him, he&nbsp;wouldnhave&nbsp;died from frost bite.&quot;</em></p><p><em>DAMN IT!</em></p><p>Luffy grabbed the outstretched hand, locking the elbow and grabbing the bely of his shorts, he swung him out of balance to topple him to the ground. Before he could get on top of him, Koby rolled back and onto his knees, grabbing at the nearest ankle to knocking him on his back.</p><p><em>&quot;The last thing he told me was that he loved me, and the last thing I did was laugh at him and call him an idiot. That's something I'll never have back...&quot;</em></p><p>Luffy jumped back onto his feet as soon as he fell. He swung harder with more force, which made him slower and easier to dodge.</p><p>Koby made some kind of snarky comment while landing a few faster and lighter punches and kicks.</p><p><em>&quot;I can't fail at this.&quot; Law had told him in his&nbsp;pleads&nbsp;to stop him from marching to Mingo's place.</em></p><p><em>&quot;You won't.&quot; Luffy had answered.</em></p><p>A heavy hit in the firefighter's gut had him stumbling back.</p><p><em>&quot;Why are you so confident in this?&quot;</em></p><p>Luffy took a step back in an attempt to regain balance while ducking from another hit to the head.</p><p><em>&quot;Because you have me.&quot;</em></p><p>With the momentum of finding himself under Koby's failed jab, Luffy struck him with an undercut that seemed to rattle his sparring partner's teeth.</p><p>Koby fell on the ground. He wasn't moving.</p><p>&quot;Hey.&quot; Luffy kicked his foot. &quot;Are alive? Get up.&quot;</p><p>There was a groan and a wince from the laying man, enough to confirm his being alive enough.</p><p>&quot;Hey, get up, I'm gonna leave now.&quot; Luffy wauted for a moment to get a response that never reached him. &quot;Okay, bye. Sorry for knocking you out.&quot;</p><p>He was a bit more calm now.</p><p>&quot;Staw boy!&quot; The guy at the front desk of the gym called. &quot;Your friend called to say you're going to be late.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nami?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I think.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, thanks, Helmet!&quot; Luffy reached over the desk to drop the boxing gear he took.</p><p>&quot;Not my name! And stop leaving all your shit here! This isn't your personal locker!&quot; The blond man scolded him but it seemed to fall on deaf ears. &quot;And for God's sake, stop coming in with flip-flops!&quot; Helmeppo tried to say, at Luffy's leaving back. (???)</p><p>At the front of the building, a too familiar car waited for him. His smile was inevitable.</p><p>The firefighter rushed to leap inside and throw his body across to the driver's seat to arorn his boyfriend with kisses. He could see a constrained smile on Torao's face.</p><p>&quot;Okay, okay, stop.&quot; Law rolled his eyes but made no move to actually stop him. &quot;Are you sure you gave me the right address?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yep.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because it's really close to here...&quot; Law looked at the map on his phone before putting it up on the car's phoneholder.</p><p>The sun had started setting but Luffy's mood had never been brighter. The same couldn't be said about the doctor.</p><p>He changed from the nutral to first gear and started driving. His hands felt a bit clammy and jittery as he gripped at the gearshift and the wheel like a lifeline.</p><p>&quot;They're gonna love you.&quot; Luffy's hand rubbed soothing circles in top of his own. It would have been more comforting that he could feel Law's nervousness without having to voice it, if it wasn't disconcerting that he was holding his hand while he was driving.</p><p>&quot;You don't know that...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Chopper thinks you're cool, Robin and Franky already love you. And so do I!&quot; He grinned.</p><p>It wasn't really comforting that he didn't mention anything about Sanji, when as far as Law knew, he was also part of the firefighter's &quot;crew&quot;.</p><p>But he couldn't really voice any of those concerns. &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p><p>The car parked in front of a tall apartment complex. With the skyline reflected off the building and the decorative orchard trees as round the front yard, the doctor already felt out of place.&nbsp;<em>Damn, there was not only a yard, but a mini orchard?&nbsp;</em>Rationally, Law knew that the podcast probably paid well, but he had no idea how Nami could aford such a high-end place. It reeked of old money. What he got as Nami's present, now, seemed a both tacky and plain.</p><p>Luffy barged in the main entrance, as if it were nothing, leaving Law to trail behind him - giving awkward waves to the building's staff that Luffy spoke to with a familiarity far too comfortable. He felt like he was picking up the crumbs off the floor of Luffy's lavish squander of warmth.</p><p><em>Law didn't belong here. He was so out of place.</em></p><p>The elevator doors opened, buttons were pressed, and then they opened once more. Loud music (surprisingly not obnoxiously so) and even louder chatter and laughing, guided them to the correct door. At the entrance there was a bowl of snacks and a &quot;for the hosts&quot; box. Law dropped ten berry before thinking better for it and dropping twenty more. Luffy grabbed a fistful of snacks and dragged him deeper into the apartment.</p><p>A gasp from the other side of the room barely warned the doctor before he got bodily dragged to a redhead that he's seen only on his phone screen.</p><p>&quot;Nami!&quot; Luffy jumped into her arms, having the decency to let go of his boyfriend's hand beforehand. His arms almost seemed like they wrapped multiple times around him with the way he was squeezing and nuzzling into.</p><p>&quot;AGH!&quot; She yelped, in shock. Her arms, much contrary to her scolding, wrapped around him to prevent him from falling.</p><p>The people around her - Usopp, from the podcast, a girl that Law didn't recognize and... was... was that Vivi? Nefertari heiress?&nbsp;<em>How many nepo babies and famous people was Luffy surrounded by?</em></p><p>&quot;So you must be the infamous Law?&quot; Nami managed to grab his attention once more, looking him up and down with a displeased glint in her eye.</p><p>Law cleared his throat as his nerves spiked once more. &quot;Yes. It's great to meet you.&quot; His hands were sweaty. He was sure of it. But not shaking her hand would be rude, wouldn't it?</p><p>She sighed, resigned when he answered her. &quot;Ugh. Great. I can't believe I lost a bet to&nbsp;<em>Zoro</em>.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don't mind her. I'm Vivi, the girlfriend.&quot; Vivi smiled. &quot;She made a bet about Luffy's type.&quot;</p><p>Shit. This was awkward now... Law hit the little bag behind his back.</p><p>&quot;My type is Traffy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, sure is.&quot; Usopp seemed amused by Nami's huffing and puffing.</p><p>&quot;Oh!&quot; The redhead's eyes clocked onto the gift, as if she could sniff it out. &quot;Is that for me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh, yeah, Luffy told me you like... Nefertari jewelry...&quot; He tried to salvage the situation with a: &quot;In hindsight, I probably shouldn't listen to him about things like that.&quot;</p><p>Nami smiled, much like one would to a child with a macaroni portrait by a five year old. &quot;I&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;like jewelry! I'll never say no to anything nice and expensive!&quot; She took the little baggy and inspected the contents. &quot;Oh! I think I don't have this actually! It's so pretty! Thank you.&quot;</p><p>Law wanted the ground to swallow him whole.</p><p>&quot;Why, hello, there, Law. How pleasant to see you here.&quot; Robin's voice rung like his saving grace.</p><p>He took a few steps to the side and join her much quieter corner. &quot;Always glad to see you, Robin.&quot; He looked around to see that Luffy was animatedly telling a story to a crowd that kept on growing. &quot;Or at least to have a-&quot; He paused. Was she a friendly face? After all she knew about him? His eyes flickered to Luffy and then back to her once more. Yes. &quot;A friendly face.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It's good to know who your friend is in times like these.&quot; She laughed but Trafalgar felt the meaning, or so he thought. &quot;The mill requires two stones, no?&quot; She covered her smile with a sip of what looked like wine in a whiskey glass.</p><p>Law furrowed his brows and did his best not to show his shock. &quot;If it were anyone else, I would call it a coincidence, but I wouldn't put it past you to know Flevian idioms.</p><p>Robin's face lit up. &quot;Yes! In fact back in O'Hara we had a similar saying when-&quot;</p><p>&quot;Robin my belived, I found the-&quot; A familiar friendly face entered their conversation. Although, perhaps &quot;friendly&quot; wasn't the tight word with the flicker of something worrying passed before the blond smiled at him.</p><p>&quot;Hey, Sanji.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hi.&quot; Sanji nodded and passed some sort of sweet desert to Robin. &quot;I could salvage some, but most of them are already gone.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That's quite alright, Sanji. Thank you.&quot; She took them.</p><p>&quot;Patin chanch ka...&quot; Law cleared his throat.</p><p>Robin laughed. It was probably the only time he's heard her laugh. &quot;Don't worry, Sanji knows my past. It's not a sensitive subject anymore.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that's... uh, nice.&quot; The doctor could physically feel the awkwardness flow back into him.</p><p><em>Was it his paranoia? His disdain of social gatherings? He couldn't be sure, but he had a creeping suspicion Sanji was glaring at him. Which was ridiculous, as he wasn't even looking at him, as he started talking to Robin while he was spacing out like a moron.</em></p><p>By the time he realized Robin had turned to look at him. &quot;- so as they say: An onion shared with a friend tastes like roast lamb.&quot;</p><p>The doctor couldn't quite remember how it was proniunced in O'Haraian, but this felt like a competition he would lose if he couldn't say it on</p><p><br></p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",
